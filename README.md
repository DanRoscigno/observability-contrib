## Observability Contrib Repository

This is a collection of code and recipes to be used in conjunction with
[Elastic Observability](https://www.elastic.co/observability). The code here is
not necessarily maintained by the core Elastic Observability Team. 

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome: recipes, visualizations, dashboards, ingest
processors, ideas, documentation, and even something you drew up on a napkin.
